# Uber-Optimization ðŸš—âœ…

The project aims to predict Uber fare prices based on various factors such as pickup location, drop-off location, passenger count, and pickup time. 

1. It follows a structured plan, starting with data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing, followed by feature selection and predictive modeling.

2. After exploring the dataset, including visualizing the distribution of features and understanding their relationships, the project performs data preprocessing tasks such as removing duplicates, converting categorical columns to numeric, handling outliers, and scaling features.

3. Feature selection techniques like VIF, RFE, and PCA are employed to address multicollinearity and select the most relevant features for modeling. Multiple regression models including Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic-Net Regression are then built and evaluated using various metrics such as R2, RMSE, and MSE.

4. The evaluation results show that MLR and RLR models perform well on the dataset, providing high R2 scores and low RMSE values. These models are chosen for their generalizability and accuracy.

Overall, the project successfully builds regression models to predict Uber fare prices and compares their performance, providing insights into the best modeling approach for this specific dataset.
